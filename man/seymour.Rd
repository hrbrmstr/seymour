'Feedly' is a news aggregator application for various web browsers and
mobile devices running 'iOS' and 'Android', also available as a cloud-based
service. It compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources for the
user to customize and share with others. Methods are provided to retrieve
information about and contents of 'Feedly' collections and streams.

\note{
Neither \code{\link[=feedly_search]{feedly_search()}} nor \code{\link[=feedly_stream]{feedly_stream()}} require authentication
(i.e. you do not need a developer token) to retrieve the contents of the
API call. For \code{feedly_stream()} You \emph{do} need to know the
Feedly-structured feed id which is (generally) \code{feed/FEED_URL}
(e.g. \code{feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/RBloggers}).
